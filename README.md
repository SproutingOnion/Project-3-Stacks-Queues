Submission: Upload on Canvas the program file with proper extension. Add your name and CWID in the beginning of the starter template. Or else, upload a link to the github repository and give me access. 
Introduction
In this project you will design and implement stack and queues operations for the web browser. You will be provided with a starter template with all the test cases. You need to create a stack and queues from scratch and need to add functions  that are specified in the document. Do not change the main function, I have added test cases in it.

Part-A (Stack Operations)
You are hired as a developer in a multinational company and you have a project to make an application that checks whether coding syntax is valid or invalid by checking all the parentheses. A valid syntax represents the proper order of opening and closing parenthesis and brackets (‘()’,’[]’,’{}’)  with equal number of them. Addition to that, the project owner told you to find out the index where error (unbalanced parenthesis is present) in the given code occurs. Also, you have to find out how many parentheses are needed to make syntax valid if it's invalid. Use vectors to implement stacks. Create following functions in Stack class:
validPara() - It will determine whether all parenthesis are completed or something is missing. It will print valid if all are completed otherwise it will print invalid. It will take one string parameter that is an expression.  
Ex: 1) ‘(({}))’ -here all parenthesis are balanced so, its valid 
      2)’(({})’ - here a one parenthesis is missing so, it is invalid 
indexError() - It will find out the first index where the actual error occurred which is invalid parentheses. It will take one string parameter that is an expression.  It will return the first index of unbalanced parenthesis. It means you have to find out first opening parenthesis for which closing parenthesis is missing Return -1 if all parenthesis are completed.
	Ex: 1) ‘(({}))’- return -1 since all are balanced
       2) ‘(({})’ - return 5 since index at 5 for opening parenthesis closing parentheses is missing 
minPara()- It will determine how many parenthesis are needed to make a string of code as a valid parenthesis string. It will take one string parameter that is an expression. It will print how many minimum parentheses are required to make the string balanced. 
	Ex: 1) ‘(({}))’- return -0 since all are balanced
       2) ‘(({})’ - return 1 since index at 5 closing parentheses is missing 
scorePara()- It will calculate how many valid parentheses are present in the given string. It will take one string parameter that is an expression. It will print how many balanced parentheses are present in the string. 
Ex: 1) ‘(({}))’- return -3 
       2) ‘(({})’ - return 2 since index at 5 closing parentheses is missing 

Part-B (Queue Operation)
The company wants you to make one message buffering system for their support team. The application divides the entire message in chunks of 8 characters and adds it into the support team’s buffer. The buffer implements queue data structure.  To make secure search the characters in a single packet are reversed. When the message is processed at that time the characters are again reversed to get the right message. Use a vector for queue operations. Write following functions in Queue class:
enqueue() - It will divide the entire message into chunks (new string) of 8 characters and insert it into the queue. Before insertion it will reverse the character of the chunk using the reverse function. It will take a string as a parameter. 
processMsg() - It will remove the chunk from the queue one by one until the queue is not empty. Then it will be reversed and the entire message will be formed. Display the entire message in this function. 
Grading Rubrics
validPara() (6 marks)
indexError() (4 marks)
minPara() (5 marks)
scorePara() (5 marks)
enqueue() (5 marks) 
processMsg (5 marks)
Successful Compilation(10 marks)
Successful run on all test cases(10 marks)- Partial marks will be given if few of them successfully run. 
What to Do
The starter template is provided. It has a main() function. Do not make any changes in the main function. Make changes in respective classes. Add the same name of a function that I mentioned above. If you make any other changes and code is giving different output. You will lose the marks. Make the submissions on time. No extensions will be provided. Late submissions will be accepted but 3% marks will be deducted.
